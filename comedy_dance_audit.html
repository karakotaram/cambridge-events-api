            <strong>Description:</strong><br>
            Comedian Jeff Greenspan shares behind-the-scenes stories from viral pranks he’s pulled on corporate crooks, privacy creeps, and other modern messes. Before comedy, Jeff was BuzzFeed’s first Chief Creative Officer, worked closely with "Zuck" at Facebook, and was a creative director at too many ad agencies to count. He turned what he learned inside the media against it, hijacking news cycles with stunts so bold even NYC’s mayor had to weigh in. Deviant Acts mixes stand-up that roasts advertising, media, and pop culture with footage from stunts like The Tourist Lanes (called “brilliant” by New York Magazine) and the covert installation of The Snowden Statue (featured by Rachel Maddow). Jeff also gets personal, revealing how the media warped his sense of self-worth as a gay man, and how it twists the way we all see ourselves. You’ll leave laughing, thinking, and maybe plotting some schemes of your own. The Bar Our Bar opens 1 hour before early shows and 20 minutes before late shows. There is a 2-Item Suggested Minimum.

He was a regular cast member on the cult favorite YouTube series Man in the Box, starring opposite Cleveland Comedy Legend and Red Lobster regular Mike Polk Jr. He has also appeared on tv shows like Laughs on Fox and Hulu.

He has become a part of a larger family of millions of devoted listeners/viewers on iHeartRadio, SiriusXM, Pandora, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher.

            Kaytlin Bailey offers a fresh perspective on the world’s oldest profession, reframing the narrative of Western civilization. Weaving history, stand-up comedy, and lived experience in a fast-paced and profoundly moving hour-long solo show. A projected art history slideshow punctuates the performance. This show is for adults who want to laugh while they learn about a historically stigmatized community in a funny, approachable, and safe way. The show appeals to academics, comedy fans, history nerds, and sex workers alike, but also appeals to conservative dads, informed moms, libertarians, progressives, feminists, and folks in the LGBTQ+ community.
