Sketch, Shade, Smudge: Drawing from Gray to Black celebrates the act of drawing using familiar tools\u2014charcoal, chalk, crayon, and graphite. Each material has distinctive properties: charcoal can be intensely rich and velvety, or delicately gray and suggestive, while graphite is slippery, shiny, and easy to erase. Crayon is deeply black and waxy, whereas chalk can be crumbly and diffuse. The creative manipulations of these media\u2014smudging, scraping, and erasing\u2014make them versatile tools for adding intensity, depth, precision, and expression to an artist\u2019s vision. The exhibition includes drawings by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Edgar Degas, Georges Seurat, John Singer Sargent, and Odilon Redon, alongside works by 20th- and 21st-century artists, such as Piet Mondrian, Lyonel Feininger, Diego Rivera, Richard Serra, John Wilson, Isabella Quintanilla, and Toyin Ojih Odutola, all of whom push their use of drawing media in new directions.",

    "description": "This event does not require registration; see further details below. Architectural drafting techniques were fundamental to Edna Andrade\u2019s practice, and knowing that Andrade created her drawings before digital software was available makes them all the more impressive. Architect Sarah Whiting, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, will give a talk about the role of drawing in architecture and design planning in the pre-digital era. Andrade\u2019s drawings take on a different valence when seen through the lens of Dean Whiting\u2019s work as an architect and educator. This talk is held in conjunction with the exhibition Edna Andrade: Imagination Is Never Static (August 30, 2025\u2013January 4, 2026). Meet Me at the Museums is a series of talks given by our campus partners, lenders, and students about their perspective on works in the collections. The series widens the circle of our offerings, allowing for a richer diversity of viewpoints, surprising interdisciplinary connections and research, and unique perspectives about our collections and exhibitions.

Join us for an in-depth tour of our special exhibition Edna Andrade: Imagination Is Never Static (August 30, 2025\u2013January 4, 2026), led by Mitra Abbaspour, co-curator of the exhibition. Edna Andrade: Imagination Is Never Static offers a new look at the practice of acclaimed artist and educator Edna Andrade (1917\u20132008). Andrade is best known for her geometric compositions, which were inspired by her interest in studying structures in nature, architecture, astronomy, mathematics, and art history, and she carried this same set of wide-ranging inspirations and inquiry to her teaching. The exhibition emphasizes the central role of drawing as well as interdisciplinary exploration in her art and in modernist movements of the 20th century. Channeling Andrade\u2019s own multifaceted approach to art and design, Imagination Is Never Static explores the way that she used drawing as a process of experimentation.",

    "description": "This event does not require registration; see further details below. If you\u2019re in the Calderwood Courtyard, you\u2019ll likely see a newly installed sculpture: a 6th-century terracotta sculpture from Japan\u2019s Kofun period (c. 250\u2013600), called a haniwa. Haniwa were created from coils and slabs of clay, shaped into figures or structures, and then placed around the outside of royal tombs. This figure underwent comprehensive analysis and treatment in preparation for its display. Join objects conservation fellow Kaela Nurmi as she shares how the conservation treatment uncovered original surfaces obscured by layers of restoration, offering insights into how the sculpture was reconstructed in the past. This gallery talk is part of our New on View series, highlighting recent gallery installations and presenting new insights into recent acquisitions or old favorites. Led by: Kaela Nurmi, Objects Conservation Fellow, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies",

    "description": "$20 at door / $15 advance / 7pm doors / seated & standing Live Music from Will Woodson (Uileann Pipes & Flute) & Caitlin Finley (Fiddle) presented by Lilypad\u2019s friend and neighbor, The Druid Pub. The Druid Pub in Inman Square, renowned for its authentic Irish atmosphere and live traditional music, is launching a new concert series spotlighting global roots music. The concert series will take place next door at The Lilypad, a cozy venue in Inman Square, offering an intimate setting for this special event. Will Woodson (flute, uilleann pipes) and Caitlin Finley (fiddle) play sparky and driving traditional Irish music that\u2019s grounded in the textures and rhythms of the rich Irish-American soundscape of the 1920s and 30s. With roots in the living Irish musical cultures of Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia, and a tremendous admiration for the first generation of recorded Irish musicians, the duo conjures up the sounds of the dance halls, vaudeville theaters, and house sessions central to Irish-American music from the first half of the twentieth century. In 2019, the two recorded their debut album, \u201cThe Glory Reel\u201d alongside box player and piano accompanist Chris \u201cJunior\u201d Stevens, which Dan Neely of the Irish Echo called \u201ca fabulous album from three of Irish America\u2019s finest.\u201d During the pandemic years, the two made \u201cThe Phonograph Project\u201d, a Patreon-supported series examining 78 recordings of traditional Irish music made in New York City in the 1920s and 30s. More recently, they\u2019ve made musical appearances at the St. Louis Tion\u00f3l, the Patrick J. Touhey Memorial Weekend in Boston and the Ward Archives \u201cArchiving Irish America\u201d conference in Milwaukee. Cait and Will live in Portland, Maine.",

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz. Along with keeping up with a busy performance schedule, each of them are well-respected educators helping to inspire the jazz musicians of tomorrow.

For this show, we will perform music from my new EP 6211, a project made possible through an award I received in the Netherlands, selections from my first album, and a glimpse of new material that continues this musical journey.\u2019\u2019Dimitris Terpizis Quartet merges tradition with modern expression, strong, driving rhythms meet delicate, introspective textures. Our sound bridges the West and Middle East, chaos and clarity, storm and calm. Dimitris Terpizis is an emerging artist who aims to emote through music and transport the listener into powerful sonic Odysseys. His musical path began early, with private lessons in drums, piano, and guitar. In 2017, he was highly active during the European Capital of Culture events, performing in Cyprus and Denmark with the Aarhus Jazz Orchestra and many renowned artists. A graduate of the Conservatory of Maastricht with honors, Dimitris has performed with several notable projects and artists across Europe including the Swing Design Big Band, Fringe Orchestra alongside Camille Bertault and Lander Gyselinck, Ruud Breuls, Orchstravian.

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

    "description": "Jesse Gallagher began living above the Lilypad in 2006, just a few blocks from where his grandfather grew up on Inman st. At the time Jesse was in the middle of what would be about a decade of regular touring, performing & recording with his psychedelic rock band Apollo Sunshine. The band was featured in the New York Times, Rolling Stone, Spin & shared the stage with legendary acts Wu-Tang Clan, Toots & The Maytals, The Flaming Lips & Dr. Dog. Jesse has been involved with the Lilypad for 20 years and the full time talent booking agent since 2013. Breaking Bad used Jesse\u2019s song \u201cWe are Born When We Die\u201d (2008) to dramatic effect. \u201cToday is the Day\u201d (2005) was in international Nike commercials while his \u201cSinging to the Earth to Thank Her For You\u201d was used in a large GAP campaign. Gallagher has collaborated, recorded & performed extensively w/ Sam Cohen, Willy Mason, Lilys, Nick Nicely, Doug Tuttle & Edan. Gallagher is a certified Yoga & Meditation teacher and hosts classes at the Lilypad & online. Since 2018, he has released 40 pieces of instrumental music which have been used in millions of YouTube videos ranging from NBC NY to Tesla and most recently a string of viral videos by Emma Chamberlain. Gallagher has a very active YouTube channel, making lots of psychedelic music videos and building a community of mindful listeners.",

The game of playing music together is too much fun to make it work. With that in mind, I refuse to write arrangements.

All materials will be provided and no experience is necessary. Final sculptures will vary in size. The tallest is Samus (13 inches) and the shortest are Mario & Link (each 6.7 inches). If you do not finish your sculpture during the event, you are welcome to take everything you need to finish it at home. If you would like to build a character that is not listed in the dropdown menu, feel free to email robertpatricklynch@gmail.com with requests. This is an all ages event.

On Tuesday, December 2, Porter Square Books will donate 10% of our in-store sales from 12PM-8PM to a number of local nonprofits working on issues important to us and our community. We know this year, for many different reasons, members of our community are having to make difficult decisions about where to spend their often increasingly limited money, wanting to support the causes that matter to them and the people in their lives that matter to them. We hope our Giving Tuesday program will make it a little easier for you by giving you a chance to do several things at once with the same spending; getting a great gift for someone you care about, supporting organizations doing great work in your community, and keeping your local fiercely independent bookstore going.",

    "description": "Harvard Book Store welcomes Tracy K. Smith\u2014the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University, former Poet Laureate of the United States, and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of five poetry collections\u2014for a discussion of her new book, Fear Less: Poetry in Perilous Times. She will be joined in conversation by Darius Atefat-Peckham\u2014Poetry Fellow at the Michener Center for Writers and the award-winning author of Book of Kin. A Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning poet reveals how poetry is a powerful tool of connection and understanding in a fractured world. Drawing on deep passion and personal experience, former US Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith demystifies the art form that has too often been mischaracterized as \u201cinaccessible,\u201d \u201cirrelevant,\u201d or \u201cintimidating.\u201d She argues that poetry is rooted in fundamentally human qualities innate to our capacities to love, dream, question, and cultivate community. Lifting the veil on her own creative process, Smith shows us how reading and writing poetry allows us to better confront life\u2019s many uncertainties and losses, build camaraderie with strangers, and understand ourselves more fully. In six insightful chapters, she grounds readers in the technical elements of the craft and provides close readings of the works of contemporary poets such as Joy Harjo, Danez Smith, and Francisco M\u00e1rquez, alongside classic poems by Dickinson, Keats, Millay, and others. By reimaging and reexamining the age-old art form, Fear Less is a warm invitation to find meaning, consolation, and hope through poetry for poetry fans and newcomers to the art form.",

He will be joined in conversation by Noah Feldman\u2014the Arthur Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard and a leading public intellectual who has authored ten critically acclaimed books. From Pulitzer Prize finalist John Fabian Witt comes the captivating secret history of an epic experiment to remake American democracy. Before the dark money of the Koch Brothers, before the billions of the Ford Foundation, there was the Garland Fund. In 1922, a young idealist named Charles Garland rejected a million-dollar inheritance. In a world of shocking wealth disparities, shameless racism, and political repression, Garland opted instead to invest in a future where radical ideas\u2014like working-class power, free speech, and equality\u2014might flourish. Over the next two decades, the Garland Fund would nurture a new generation of wildly ambi\u00adtious progressive projects.",
