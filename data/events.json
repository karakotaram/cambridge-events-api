    "description": "Medicare Open Enrollment is the one time of the year when all people with Medicare can review, compare, enroll or dis-enroll in Medicare Advantage, Original Medicare, and Part D drug plans. Medicare Open Enrollment runs from mid-October to early December. Coverage of all plans begins January 1 of the following year. Open Enrollment is your annual opportunity to review health and drug plans. This is important because health needs may change from year to year; health or drug plan may change the costs, benefits, and drug coverage they offer; provider and pharmacy networks may change. By reviewing and comparing costs and benefits of the plans available for the upcoming year, there is potential to save money and ensure appropriate coverage. This class will explain how Open Enrollment works and demonstrate the tools available to help you review your options. This workshop is led by Marion Severynse, a state-certified Medicare benefits counselor in a volunteer-led program funded in part by the Executive Office of Aging and Independence.

    "description": "\"What would you say to Time if you got the chance?\u201d Michael Talbot asks in his new exhibition, \u201cConversations With Time,\u201d at Cambridge Arts\u2019 Gallery 344 from Nov. 17, 2025, to Jan. 16, 2026. Join us for an opening reception on Nov. 17 from 5 to 8 p.m., with a poetry reading at 6 p.m. Admission to all events is always free. The exhibition showcases new paintings by the Jamaican-born, Boston-based artist as well as Talbot\u2019s design for his upcoming mural at Cambridge\u2019s Gold Star Mothers Park, between Gore Street and Rufo Road. The park mural is funded through the City of Cambridge\u2019s first-in-the-state Percent-for-Art Ordinance, which requires that 1 percent of city capital construction costs be designated for creating site-responsive public artworks. Talbot is known for his murals throughout the Boston area, including at Cambridge Crossing, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, and the New England Patriots Gillette Stadium in Foxboro. He has collaborated with some of the most prominent mural artists in the region, including Rob \"ProBlak\" Gibbs, Genaro \"GoFive\" Ortega, Lee \"Soems\" Beard and Ricardo \"Deme5\" Gomez. In the exhibition, explore the full range of Talbot's art\u2014murals, painting, graphic design, comics, and community-based collaborations. \u201cConversations With Time\u201d is inspired by \u201cAtlas,\u201d Talbot\u2019s three-part graphic novel series about cosmic guardians tasked with maintaining reality, including the orphan Atlas, who discovers she has the ability to control and manipulate time. With this discovery, she now has a choice to make - accept the mantle and responsibility of being the Guardian of Time itself, or give it all up to live the life she imagined for herself with the people she loves. In the exhibition, Talbot\u2019s paintings burst off the edges of his canvases and across the gallery walls to create an immersive space of magic necklaces and swirling energy. Talbot\u2019s art invites visitors to pause and consider how shifting perceptions shape our memories and daily lives through",

We have the feel of chamber jazz but the energy of the full jazz orchestra. The writing style of the composers is fairly diverse and always interesting.

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz. Along with keeping up with a busy performance schedule, each of them are well-respected educators helping to inspire the jazz musicians of tomorrow.

After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind.

    "description": "Attend one of our most beloved, longest standing brewery traditions: Trivia Tuesday! Every Tuesday swing by our Broadway taproom for our weekly trivia night. It\u2019s free to compete, and winners get beer money. Here\u2019s how it works: show up with your team of 2 \u2013 6 players starting at 7:00 pm, when we\u2019ll open the doors to the back taproom. Head down the hallway to the back, then snag a seat. All seating is first come first serve, so we recommend arriving early \u2013 there generally is a line! The game will start at 7:30 pm, and is about two hours long (with plenty of beer breaks, of course). Questions rotate every week, and cover categories ranging from history, politics, sports, movies, pop culture, music, and more. At the end of the game, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place teams will be awarded Lamplighter gift cards \u2013 good for usage in either of our taprooms and at Pepita Coffee Co. In addition to Trivia Tuesday at our Broadway taproom, we also host weekly trivia at our CX taproom. That game takes place on Monday evenings, and is also free to join for teams of 2 \u2013 6. We\u2019d love to see you at either or both! Hungry? Munch on our signature giant soft pretzels or some crunchy nachos, which are available Tuesday evenings only. You\u2019re also always welcome to bring your own food or order in, ask our staff for their favorite local recommendations. See you at trivia night! You must be 21+ attend, all guests will be asked to show valid government ID. Questions? Get in touch! You can reach us at events@lamplighterbrewing.com",

It\u2019s free to compete, and winners get beer money. Here\u2019s how it works: show up with your team of 2 \u2013 6 players starting at 7:00 pm, when we\u2019ll open the doors to the back taproom. Head down the hallway to the back, then snag a seat. All seating is first come first serve, so we recommend arriving early \u2013 there generally is a line! The game will start at 7:30 pm, and is about two hours long (with plenty of beer breaks, of course). Questions rotate every week, and cover categories ranging from history, politics, sports, movies, pop culture, music, and more. At the end of the game, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place teams will be awarded Lamplighter gift cards \u2013 good for usage in either of our taprooms and at Pepita Coffee Co. In addition to Trivia Tuesday at our Broadway taproom, we also host weekly trivia at our CX taproom. That game takes place on Monday evenings, and is also free to join for teams of 2 \u2013 6. We\u2019d love to see you at either or both! Hungry? Munch on our signature giant soft pretzels or some crunchy nachos, which are available Tuesday evenings only. You\u2019re also always welcome to bring your own food or order in, ask our staff for their favorite local recommendations. See you at trivia night! You must be 21+ attend, all guests will be asked to show valid government ID. Questions? Get in touch! You can reach us at events@lamplighterbrewing.com",

He will be joined in conversation by Philip J. Deloria\u2014Leverett Saltonstall Professor of History at Harvard University, and the author of Playing Indian, Indians in Unexpected Places. The forgotten life and complex legacies of Wakara, the mighty, once-notorious Native leader whose battles and conquests shaped the American West\u2014a \u201csobering reassessment\u201d that centers the \u201cdisruptive and violent influences of colonialism\u201d. (Ned Blackhawk, National Book Award\u2013winning author of The Rediscovery of America) The Native American leader Wakara (ca. 1815\u20131855) was among the most influential and feared men in the nineteenth-century American West, famed as a fierce warrior, a merciless trader of Indian slaves, and history\u2019s greatest horse thief. In Wakara's America, historian Max Perry Mueller illuminates Wakara\u2019s complex and sometimes paradoxical story, revealing a man who both helped build the settler American West and defended Native sovereignty. Wakara was baptized a Mormon and allied with Mormon settlers against other Indians to seize large parts of modern-day Utah. Yet a pan-tribal uprising against the Mormons that now bears Wakara\u2019s name stalled and even temporarily reversed colonial expansion. Through diplomacy and through violence, Wakara oversaw the establishment of settlements, built new trade routes, and helped create the boundaries that still define the region. Drawing together deep archival research with Native oral histories, archaeology, geology, and ecology, Wakara's America offers an innovative new vision of the history of the American West with Native people at its center",

She will be joined in conversation by Margaret Burnham\u2014University Distinguished Professor of Law at Northeastern University and author of By Hands Now Known: Jim Crow\u2019s Legal Executioners. Troublemaker tells the wild and unlikely story of Jessica Mitford, fifth of the six famous Mitford Girls, a British aristocrat-turned-American Communist, famous for expos\u00e9s like The American Way of Death; this biography brings her astonishing self-transformation to life with a riveting, often hilarious account of trading wealth and status for a life of radical activism. Who could predict that a British aristocrat would so energize American antifascist and civil rights struggles that Time magazine would crown her \u201cQueen of the Muckrakers\u201d? Jessica Mitford, always known as Decca, was brought up by an eccentric English family to marry well and reproduce her wealth and privilege, not to advocate for the rights of others. Her beautiful sisters have been subjects of books and movies dedicated to their naughty, glamorous lives. Decca ran away to America to forge a rebel\u2019s life. As this richly researched book details, Decca broke the Mitford mold. Instead of settling for life as a professional Beauty, she fought fascism in the Spanish Civil War, became an American Communist and pioneered witty, hugely popular journalism, including her 1963 blockbuster The American Way of Death. Decca dedicated her life to social justice and proved herself an immensely effective ally, but she also injected laughter into all her political work, annoying some activists with her relentless antics but encouraging many others to find joy in the struggle. From famed baby doctor Benjamin Spock to best friend Maya Angelou, her",

He will be joined in conversation by Manisha Sinha\u2014the Draper Chair in American History at the University of Connecticut and Past President of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. A landmark event years in the making, a brilliant global narrative that unravels the defining story of the past thousand years of human history No other phenomenon has shaped human history as decisively as capitalism. It structures how we live and work, how we think about ourselves and others, how we organize our politics. Sven Beckert, author of the Bancroft Prize\u2013winning Empire of Cotton, places the story of capitalism within the largest conceivable geographical and historical framework, tracing its history during the past millennium and across the world. An epic achievement, his book takes us into merchant businesses in Aden and car factories in Turin, onto the terrifyingly violent sugar plantations in Barbados, and within the world of women workers in textile factories in today\u2019s Cambodia. Capitalism, argues Beckert, was born global. Emerging from trading communities across Asia, Africa, and Europe, capitalism\u2019s radical recasting of economic life rooted itself only gradually. But then it burst onto the world scene, as a powerful alliance between European states and merchants propelled them, and their economic logic, across the oceans. This, Beckert shows, was modern capitalism\u2019s big bang, and one of its epicenters was the slave labor camps of the Caribbean. This system, with its hierarchies that haunt us still, provided the liftoff for the radical transformations of the Industrial Revolution. Fueled by vast productivity increases along with coal and oil, capitalism pulled down old ways of life to crown itself the defining force of the modern world. This epic d",

He will be joined in conversation by Zohra Ahmed\u2014an associate professor of law at Boston University. For readers of His Name Is George Floyd and Under the Skin. A landmark investigation into forensic medicine that exposes the systematic concealment of state-sanctioned violence through death investigations Each year, police officers kill over 1,000 people they've sworn to protect and serve. While some cases, like George Floyd's and Sandra Bland's, capture national attention, most victims remain nameless, their stories untold. The Coroner's Silence reveals a disturbing truth about these cases: coroners and other death investigators are often complicit in obscuring the violent circumstances of in-custody deaths. Through rigorous research\u2014including critical records analysis, public health studies, and interviews with victims' families\u2014this book unmasks the systemic failures within forensic medicine. Terence Keel shows how incomplete autopsy reports, mishandled medical documents, and strategically lost evidence effectively shield law enforcement from accountability. The Coroner\u2019s Silence uncovers how the current system of death investigation operates as a mechanism of institutional safeguarding. By highlighting the structural powerlessness of coroners and their disconnection from the communities most affected by police violence, Keel demonstrates how bureaucratic processes can render human suffering invisible. True accountability requires more than procedural reform. It demands a fundamental reimagining of how we investigate, document, and understand deaths at the hands of state institutions. The Coroner's Silence is a crucial in",
