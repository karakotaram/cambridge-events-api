    "description": "Medicare Open Enrollment is the one time of the year when all people with Medicare can review, compare, enroll or dis-enroll in Medicare Advantage, Original Medicare, and Part D drug plans. Medicare Open Enrollment runs from mid-October to early December. Coverage of all plans begins January 1 of the following year. Open Enrollment is your annual opportunity to review health and drug plans. This is important because health needs may change from year to year; health or drug plan may change the costs, benefits, and drug coverage they offer; provider and pharmacy networks may change. By reviewing and comparing costs and benefits of the plans available for the upcoming year, there is potential to save money and ensure appropriate coverage. This class will explain how Open Enrollment works and demonstrate the tools available to help you review your options. This workshop is led by Marion Severynse, a state-certified Medicare benefits counselor in a volunteer-led program funded in part by the Executive Office of Aging and Independence.

    "description": "\"What would you say to Time if you got the chance?\u201d Michael Talbot asks in his new exhibition, \u201cConversations With Time,\u201d at Cambridge Arts\u2019 Gallery 344 from Nov. 17, 2025, to Jan. 16, 2026. Join us for an opening reception on Nov. 17 from 5 to 8 p.m., with a poetry reading at 6 p.m. Admission to all events is always free. The exhibition showcases new paintings by the Jamaican-born, Boston-based artist as well as Talbot\u2019s design for his upcoming mural at Cambridge\u2019s Gold Star Mothers Park, between Gore Street and Rufo Road. The park mural is funded through the City of Cambridge\u2019s first-in-the-state Percent-for-Art Ordinance, which requires that 1 percent of city capital construction costs be designated for creating site-responsive public artworks. Talbot is known for his murals throughout the Boston area, including at Cambridge Crossing, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, and the New England Patriots Gillette Stadium in Foxboro. He has collaborated with some of the most prominent mural artists in the region, including Rob \"ProBlak\" Gibbs, Genaro \"GoFive\" Ortega, Lee \"Soems\" Beard and Ricardo \"Deme5\" Gomez. In the exhibition, explore the full range of Talbot's art\u2014murals, painting, graphic design, comics, and community-based collaborations. \u201cConversations With Time\u201d is inspired by \u201cAtlas,\u201d Talbot\u2019s three-part graphic novel series about cosmic guardians tasked with maintaining reality, including the orphan Atlas, who discovers she has the ability to control and manipulate time. With this discovery, she now has a choice to make - accept the mantle and responsibility of being the Guardian of Time itself, or give it all up to live the life she imagined for herself with the people she loves. In the exhibition, Talbot\u2019s paintings burst off the edges of his canvases and across the gallery walls to create an immersive space of magic necklaces and swirling energy. Talbot\u2019s art invites visitors to pause and consider how shifting perceptions shape our memories and daily lives through",

    "description": "Darning is a fabric mending technique that involves reinforcing or re-weaving a portion of fabric by hand. In this workshop, we\u2019ll learn how to visibly mend holes and weak areas in sweaters, socks, and other knit fabrics using seed stitch and square darning techniques. You\u2019ll leave with a sampler of both techniques that you can refer back to when tackling your own darning projects at home. Suitable for beginners with little or no darning experience, though it does help if you have some experience with hand sewing.",

Starting at the library\u2019s front lawn, we will explore how conventional designs can undermine biodiversity and tree health. What makes a space truly nature-friendly? Can a lawn, sidewalk, or plaza be transformed into habitat? We will compare low-functioning green spaces with examples of micro-forests, native plantings, and meadows. Along the way, we will observe seasonal changes in plants and wildlife through the lens of phenology, the study of nature\u2019s calendar. We will also introduce simple participatory science tools that help monitor habitat quality, foster community engagement, and inform better decisions. Even a modest native plant patch can be a pocket of resilience. Come learn how to spot, support, and reimagine urban nature that works with the ecosystem, not just mimics it. The program will start with a workshop in the Rossi Room, then move outside to Joan Lorentz Park. Registration required.",

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz. Along with keeping up with a busy performance schedule, each of them are well-respected educators helping to inspire the jazz musicians of tomorrow.

The game of playing music together is too much fun to make it work. With that in mind, I refuse to write arrangements.

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

The game of playing music together is too much fun to make it work. With that in mind, I refuse to write arrangements.

All materials will be provided and no experience is necessary. Final sculptures will vary in size. The tallest is Samus (13 inches) and the shortest are Mario & Link (each 6.7 inches). If you do not finish your sculpture during the event, you are welcome to take everything you need to finish it at home. If you would like to build a character that is not listed in the dropdown menu, feel free to email robertpatricklynch@gmail.com with requests. This is an all ages event. Children under 13 should be signed up at their parent/guardian's discretion. They will need adult supervision and have the ability to sit and do a project for 1-2 hours without being disruptive.",
