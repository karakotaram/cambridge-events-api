    "description": "Jesse Gallagher began living above the Lilypad in 2006, just a few blocks from where his grandfather grew up on Inman st. At the time Jesse was in the middle of what would be about a decade of regular touring, performing & recording with his psychedelic rock band Apollo Sunshine. The band was featured in the New York Times, Rolling Stone, Spin & shared the stage with legendary acts Wu-Tang Clan, Toots & The Maytals, The Flaming Lips & Dr. Dog. Jesse has been involved with the Lilypad for 20 years and the full time talent booking agent since 2013. Breaking Bad used Jesse\u2019s song \u201cWe are Born When We Die\u201d (2008) to dramatic effect. \u201cToday is the Day\u201d (2005) was in international Nike commercials while his \u201cSinging to the Earth to Thank Her For You\u201d was used in a large GAP campaign. Gallagher has collaborated, recorded & performed extensively w/ Sam Cohen, Willy Mason, Lilys, Nick Nicely, Doug Tuttle & Edan. Gallagher is a certified Yoga & Meditation teacher and hosts classes at the Lilypad & online. Since 2018, he has released 40 pieces of instrumental music which have been used in millions of YouTube videos ranging from NBC NY to Tesla and most recently a string of viral videos by Emma Chamberlain. Gallagher has a very active YouTube channel, making lots of psychedelic music videos and building a community of mindful listeners.",

The game of playing music together is too much fun to make it work. With that in mind, I refuse to write arrangements. I never want my friends and bandmates to feel obliged to do anything. - Gill Aharon",

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz. Along with keeping up with a busy performance schedule, each of them are well-respected educators helping to inspire the jazz musicians of tomorrow.

He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

    "description": "$15 / $10 students / 10pm doors / 10:30 -12:30 show / seated Nick and Liz have put together a dynamic quartet comprised of some of Boston's finest to perform some uncommon standards and fiery original repertoire. The house band will play a set up front followed by an open jam session. Wielding a unique, incisive but soulful voice as an improviser and composer, Boston-based jazz saxophonist Nicholas Brust (pronounced \u201cBruhst\u201d) has established his voice in the world of modern improvised music. He has found his niche as a bandleader and sideman, taking advantage of the numerous textures and combinations available in the traditional jazz small-group format. Brust has performed and/or recorded with numerous highly acclaimed musicians, including Lage Lund, Gilad Hekselman (with bassist Jon Latona), Mark Ferber (with pianist Francesca Prihasti), The Peter Silver Big Band (sharing the stage with Roy Hargrove, Jimmy Owens, Steve Wilson and others), guitarist Ben Eunson, Kristina Koller (appearing in her Quintet at the 2020 NYC Winter Jazz Fest), and many others. Nicholas is currently on faculty at New England Conservatory as part of its Prep/Continuing Education division in addition to being an Artslink Teaching Artist for Berklee College of Music\u2019s City Music program. Pianist and composer Liz Sinn has become an in-demand collaborator in New England\u2019s vibrant music scene, her journey rooted at Berklee College of Music. Though specializing in jazz, Liz brings versatility across genres, including various Latin American music styles, classical, musical theater, and pop. While in Boston, Liz has had the opportunity to perform with many notable musicians, including GRAMMY Award winners Neal Smith and Charlie Rosen\u2019s 8-Bit Big Band, as well as internationally recognized artists Il Divo, Chlo\u00eb Agnew of Celtic Woman, and Rafael Barata. Her skills as an arranger and copyist have also led to collaborations with renowned Latin American artists Andr\u00e9s Cepeda and Daym\u00e9 Arocena, showcasin",

He will be joined in conversation by Durba Mitra\u2014feminist historian and theorist and author of the award-winning book Indian Sex Life: Sexuality and the Colonial Origins of Modern Social Thought. Scholarship and performance combine to show how drag can be a blueprint for critique, care, teaching, and worldmaking. Lessons in Drag brings to life a vibrant and thought-provoking dialogue between scholar Kareem Khubchandani and his drag persona LaWhore Vagistan. Beginning with an intimate interview, the book unfolds in alternating chapters where the two exchange insights, stories, and critiques. Khubchandani delves into the lessons LaWhore\u2019s drag practice offers about academia\u2014shaping his approaches to research, teaching, and writing\u2014while Vagistan reveals how Khubchandani\u2019s scholarship influences her performances, inspiring her understanding of fashion, music, divas, and aunties. Together, their reflections and conversations weave a compelling tapestry of drag\u2019s instructive power. Witty, bold, and deeply personal, Lessons in Drag is both an invitation to explore drag as a practice and a celebration of its transformative potential. \u201cShrewdly defying the conventions that often keep academic texts dry and sequestered . . .

He will be joined in conversation by Philip J. Deloria\u2014Leverett Saltonstall Professor of History at Harvard University, and the author of Playing Indian, Indians in Unexpected Places. The forgotten life and complex legacies of Wakara, the mighty, once-notorious Native leader whose battles and conquests shaped the American West\u2014a \u201csobering reassessment\u201d that centers the \u201cdisruptive and violent influences of colonialism\u201d. (Ned Blackhawk, National Book Award\u2013winning author of The Rediscovery of America) The Native American leader Wakara (ca. 1815\u20131855) was among the most influential and feared men in the nineteenth-century American West, famed as a fierce warrior, a merciless trader of Indian slaves, and history\u2019s greatest horse thief. In Wakara's America, historian Max Perry Mueller illuminates Wakara\u2019s complex and sometimes paradoxical story, revealing a man who both helped build the settler American West and defended Native sovereignty. Wakara was baptized a Mormon and allied with Mormon settlers against other Indians to seize large parts of modern-day Utah. Yet a pan-tribal uprising against the Mormons that now bears Wakara\u2019s name stalled and even temporarily reversed colonial expansion. Through diplomacy and through violence, Wakara oversaw the establishment of settlements, built new trade routes, and helped create the boundaries that still define the region. Drawing together deep archival research with Native oral histories, archaeology, geology, and ecology, Wakara's America offers an innovative new vision of the history of the American West with Native people at its center",

She will be joined in conversation by Margaret Burnham\u2014University Distinguished Professor of Law at Northeastern University and author of By Hands Now Known: Jim Crow\u2019s Legal Executioners. Troublemaker tells the wild and unlikely story of Jessica Mitford, fifth of the six famous Mitford Girls, a British aristocrat-turned-American Communist, famous for expos\u00e9s like The American Way of Death; this biography brings her astonishing self-transformation to life with a riveting, often hilarious account of trading wealth and status for a life of radical activism. Who could predict that a British aristocrat would so energize American antifascist and civil rights struggles that Time magazine would crown her \u201cQueen of the Muckrakers\u201d? Jessica Mitford, always known as Decca, was brought up by an eccentric English family to marry well and reproduce her wealth and privilege, not to advocate for the rights of others. Her beautiful sisters have been subjects of books and movies dedicated to their naughty, glamorous lives. Decca ran away to America to forge a rebel\u2019s life. As this richly researched book details, Decca broke the Mitford mold. Instead of settling for life as a professional Beauty, she fought fascism in the Spanish Civil War, became an American Communist and pioneered witty, hugely popular journalism, including her 1963 blockbuster The American Way of Death. Decca dedicated her life to social justice and proved herself an immensely effective ally, but she also injected laughter into all her political work, annoying some activists with her relentless antics but encouraging many others to find joy in the struggle.

He will be joined in conversation by Manisha Sinha\u2014the Draper Chair in American History at the University of Connecticut and Past President of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. A landmark event years in the making, a brilliant global narrative that unravels the defining story of the past thousand years of human history No other phenomenon has shaped human history as decisively as capitalism. It structures how we live and work, how we think about ourselves and others, how we organize our politics. Sven Beckert, author of the Bancroft Prize\u2013winning Empire of Cotton, places the story of capitalism within the largest conceivable geographical and historical framework, tracing its history during the past millennium and across the world. An epic achievement, his book takes us into merchant businesses in Aden and car factories in Turin, onto the terrifyingly violent sugar plantations in Barbados, and within the world of women workers in textile factories in today\u2019s Cambodia. Capitalism, argues Beckert, was born global. Emerging from trading communities across Asia, Africa, and Europe, capitalism\u2019s radical recasting of economic life rooted itself only gradually. But then it burst onto the world scene, as a powerful alliance between European states and merchants propelled them, and their economic logic, across the oceans. This, Beckert shows, was modern capitalism\u2019s big bang, and one of its epicenters was the slave labor camps of the Caribbean. This system, with its hierarchies that haunt us still, provided the liftoff for the radical transformations of the Industrial Revolution. Fueled by vast productivity increases along with coal and oil, capitalism pulled down old ways of life to crown itself the defining force of the modern world. This epic d",

By reviewing and comparing costs and benefits of the plans available for the upcoming year, there is potential to save money and ensure appropriate coverage.

Join us for a lively discussion of a great book in person at the Main Library! Snacks will be provided. For ages 7-10 and a parent or caregiver. This month's book is Pie by Sarah Weeks.

    "description": "Medicare Open Enrollment is the one time of the year when all people with Medicare can review, compare, enroll or dis-enroll in Medicare Advantage, Original Medicare, and Part D drug plans. Medicare Open Enrollment runs from mid-October to early December. Coverage of all plans begins January 1 of the following year. Open Enrollment is your annual opportunity to review health and drug plans. This is important because health needs may change from year to year; health or drug plan may change the costs, benefits, and drug coverage they offer; provider and pharmacy networks may change. By reviewing and comparing costs and benefits of the plans available for the upcoming year, there is potential to save money and ensure appropriate coverage. This class will explain how Open Enrollment works and demonstrate the tools available to help you review your options. This workshop is led by Marion Severynse, a state-certified Medicare benefits counselor in a volunteer-led program funded in part by the Executive Office of Aging and Independence. Registration required.",

    "description": "\"What would you say to Time if you got the chance?\u201d Michael Talbot asks in his new exhibition, \u201cConversations With Time,\u201d at Cambridge Arts\u2019 Gallery 344 from Nov. 17, 2025, to Jan. 16, 2026. Join us for an opening reception on Nov. 17 from 5 to 8 p.m., with a poetry reading at 6 p.m. Admission to all events is always free. The exhibition showcases new paintings by the Jamaican-born, Boston-based artist as well as Talbot\u2019s design for his upcoming mural at Cambridge\u2019s Gold Star Mothers Park, between Gore Street and Rufo Road. The park mural is funded through the City of Cambridge\u2019s first-in-the-state Percent-for-Art Ordinance, which requires that 1 percent of city capital construction costs be designated for creating site-responsive public artworks. Talbot is known for his murals throughout the Boston area, including at Cambridge Crossing, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, and the New England Patriots Gillette Stadium in Foxboro. He has collaborated with some of the most prominent mural artists in the region, including Rob \"ProBlak\" Gibbs, Genaro \"GoFive\" Ortega, Lee \"Soems\" Beard and Ricardo \"Deme5\" Gomez. In the exhibition, explore the full range of Talbot's art\u2014murals, painting, graphic design, comics, and community-based collaborations. \u201cConversations With Time\u201d is inspired by \u201cAtlas,\u201d Talbot\u2019s three-part graphic novel series about cosmic guardians tasked with maintaining reality, including the orphan Atlas, who discovers she has the ability to control and manipulate time. With this discovery, she now has a choice to make - accept the mantle and responsibility of being the Guardian of Time itself, or give it all up to live the life she imagined for herself with the people she loves. In the exhibition, Talbot\u2019s paintings burst off the edges of his canvases and across the gallery walls to create an immersive space of magic necklaces and swirling energy. Talbot\u2019s art invites visitors to pause and consider how shifting perceptions shape our memories and daily lives through ",

    "description": "Join Earthwise Aware for a thought-provoking workshop examining how land use and climate change influence the design, function, and future of urban green spaces. Starting at the library\u2019s front lawn, we will explore how conventional designs can undermine biodiversity and tree health. What makes a space truly nature-friendly? Can a lawn, sidewalk, or plaza be transformed into habitat? We will compare low-functioning green spaces with examples of micro-forests, native plantings, and meadows. Along the way, we will observe seasonal changes in plants and wildlife through the lens of phenology, the study of nature\u2019s calendar. We will also introduce simple participatory science tools that help monitor habitat quality, foster community engagement, and inform better decisions. Even a modest native plant patch can be a pocket of resilience. Come learn how to spot, support, and reimagine urban nature that works with the ecosystem, not just mimics it. The program will start with a workshop in the Rossi Room, then move outside to Joan Lorentz Park. Registration required.",
