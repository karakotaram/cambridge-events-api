The Druid Pub in Inman Square, renowned for its authentic Irish atmosphere and live traditional music, is launching a new concert series spotlighting global roots music. The concert series will take place next door at The Lilypad, a cozy venue in Inman Square, offering an intimate setting for this special event. Will Woodson (flute, uilleann pipes) and Caitlin Finley (fiddle) play sparky and driving traditional Irish music that\u2019s grounded in the textures and rhythms of the rich Irish-American soundscape of the 1920s and 30s. With roots in the living Irish musical cultures of Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia, and a tremendous admiration for the first generation of recorded Irish musicians, the duo conjures up the sounds of the dance halls, vaudeville theaters, and house sessions central to Irish-American music from the first half of the twentieth century. In 2019, the two recorded their debut album, \u201cThe Glory Reel\u201d alongside box player and piano accompanist Chris \u201cJunior\u201d Stevens, which Dan Neely of the Irish Echo called \u201ca fabulous album from three of Irish America\u2019s finest.\u201d During the pandemic years, the two made \u201cThe Phonograph Project\u201d, a Patreon-supported series examining 78 recordings of traditional Irish music made in New York City in the 1920s and 30s. More recently, they\u2019ve made musical appearances at the St. Louis Tion\u00f3l, the Patrick J. Touhey Memorial Weekend in Boston and the Ward Archives \u201cArchiving Irish America\u201d conference in Milwaukee. Cait and Will live in Portland, Maine.",

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz. Along with keeping up with a busy performance schedule, each of them are well-respected educators helping to inspire the jazz musicians of tomorrow.

    "description": "American cinematic rock band MAKUTA, with support by acclaimed singer-songwriter Keli Nicole Price, present an afternoon of music. MAKUTA is Doug, Aleata, and Rose Makuta, an American cinematic rock band out of New York. Their forthcoming album is supported by extensive touring \u2014 both domestically and internationally (including a headlining date at the world-renowned Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland). Their songs have been featured on Wells Fargo, CBS, and more, and they have also collaborated, and written for/with fellow artist friends, including Janis Ian, Ab-Liva, Ron Carter, and others. Keli Nicole Price is an award-winning songwriter and vocalist. Her professional career started at the age of 17, when she was asked to tour with Missy Elliott, Timbaland, and Aaliyah (a.k.a. the Superfriends) during her first semester at HBCU, Elizabeth City State University. As a lead, backing, and studio vocalist, she achieved success working for Elektra Records, Warner Music Group, Sony Records, and many others. While learning the business, Price was quick to add songwriter to her credentials. She began ghostwriting for many popular artists on the labels she was already working with and was soon acknowledged with her first songwriting credits on the Why Do Fools Fall in Lovemovie soundtrack. Price has continued to build her catalogue by writing, arranging, vocal producing, and singing on a number of albums. Her credits include Solange Knowles, Rodney Jerkins, slain hip-hop mogul Nipsey Hussle, Destiny\u2019s Child, PJ Morton, and Will Smith. She penned the viral TikTok dance hit \"Can't Get Enough\" by R&B star Tamia and also received three Grammy nominations for writing Beyonce\u2019s No. 1 single \u201cDeja Vu,\u201d which went on to win a Grammy for Best Contemporary R&B Album. Academically, Price has continued to connect budding artists and songwriters with their passions in music. During the pandemic, she began educating and creating curriculums for organizations in Virginia Beach, Virgi",

    "description": "When Ian Coss graduated from high school he had a lot of free time and not a lot of money, so as a way to avoid buying Christmas presents for the family he instead created a short album of original holiday songs. But these were not songs of about reindeer or crackling fireplaces; they were, as the plastic jewel case advertised: \u201csongs of alienation, disillusionment and loss.\u201d Twenty years later that tradition is somehow going strong \u2014 though it has shed at least a little of the teenage angst \u2014 and to mark the occasion Ian is assembling a band to play *for the first time ever* a concert of songs from the vast Cossmas classics catalogue.",

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz. Along with keeping up with a busy performance schedule, each of them are well-respected educators helping to inspire the jazz musicians of tomorrow.

Lilit Hartunian performs at the forefront of contemporary music innovation, both as soloist and highly in-demand collaborative artist. First prize winner in the 2021 Black House Collective New Music Soloist Competition, her \u201cPaganiniesque virtuosity\u201d and \u201ccaptivating and luxurious tone\u201d (Boston Musical Intelligencer) are frequently on display at major concert halls and leading academic institutions, where she often appears as both soloist and new music specialist. Lilit appears regularly with A Far Cry, Emmanuel Music, Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Sound Icon, and Ludovico Ensemble. Recent highlights include co-founding violin and cimbalom duo Lamnth, performing at the Boston Symphony Orchestra\u2019s \u201cLigeti 100\u201d chamber music concerts in Symphony Hall, and appearing on the 2023 Grammy-winning album for Best Contemporary Classical Composition. Described as \u201cbrilliantly rhapsodic\u201d by the Harvard Crimson, she can be heard on New Focus Recordings, Innova Recordings, Albany Records, and New Amsterdam Records. Oboist, Margaret Herlehy was born into a musical family in New Rochelle, New York in 1959. Growing up, she recalls an attic filled with her grandfather\u2019s instruments as her experimental playground where she would spend hours figuring out popular tunes on them. At the suggestion of her middle school band director, she started studying the oboe and began playing professionally alongside her teacher Lois Wann at the age of 16. She continued her classical training at the University of Michigan, but an interest in the avant-garde drew her back to New York and to Sarah Lawrence College where she became immersed in the contemporary music scene of the 1980s, premiering new works\u2014including at annual Carnegie Recital Hall performances.

You will then be guided step by step on how to glue the blocks together to make a wooden model of a character from the 8-bit era of gaming. All materials will be provided and no experience is necessary. Final sculptures will vary in size. The tallest is Samus (13 inches) and the shortest are Mario & Link (each 6.7 inches). If you do not finish your sculpture during the event, you are welcome to take everything you need to finish it at home. If you would like to build a character that is not listed in the dropdown menu, feel free to email robertpatricklynch@gmail.com with requests. This is an all ages event. Children under 13 should be signed up at their parent/guardian's discretion. They will need adult supervision and have the ability to sit and do a project for 1-2 hours without being disruptive.",

Sketch, Shade, Smudge: Drawing from Gray to Black celebrates the act of drawing using familiar tools\u2014charcoal, chalk, crayon, and graphite. Each material has distinctive properties: charcoal can be intensely rich and velvety, or delicately gray and suggestive, while graphite is slippery, shiny, and easy to erase. Crayon is deeply black and waxy, whereas chalk can be crumbly and diffuse. The creative manipulations of these media\u2014smudging, scraping, and erasing\u2014make them versatile tools for adding intensity, depth, precision, and expression to an artist\u2019s vision. The exhibition includes drawings by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Edgar Degas, Georges Seurat, John Singer Sargent, and Odilon Redon, alongside works by 20th- and 21st-century artists, such as Piet Mondrian, Lyonel Feininger, Diego Rivera, Richard Serra, John Wilson, Isabella Quintanilla, and Toyin Ojih Odutola, all of whom push their use of drawing media in new directions.

    "description": "This event does not require registration; see further details below. Architectural drafting techniques were fundamental to Edna Andrade\u2019s practice, and knowing that Andrade created her drawings before digital software was available makes them all the more impressive. Architect Sarah Whiting, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, will give a talk about the role of drawing in architecture and design planning in the pre-digital era. Andrade\u2019s drawings take on a different valence when seen through the lens of Dean Whiting\u2019s work as an architect and educator. This talk is held in conjunction with the exhibition Edna Andrade: Imagination Is Never Static (August 30, 2025\u2013January 4, 2026). Meet Me at the Museums is a series of talks given by our campus partners, lenders, and students about their perspective on works in the collections. The series widens the circle of our offerings, allowing for a richer diversity of viewpoints, surprising interdisciplinary connections and research, and unique perspectives about our collections and exhibitions.

Join us for an in-depth tour of our special exhibition Edna Andrade: Imagination Is Never Static (August 30, 2025\u2013January 4, 2026), led by Mitra Abbaspour, co-curator of the exhibition. Edna Andrade: Imagination Is Never Static offers a new look at the practice of acclaimed artist and educator Edna Andrade (1917\u20132008). Andrade is best known for her geometric compositions, which were inspired by her interest in studying structures in nature, architecture, astronomy, mathematics, and art history, and she carried this same set of wide-ranging inspirations and inquiry to her teaching. The exhibition emphasizes the central role of drawing as well as interdisciplinary exploration in her art and in modernist movements of the 20th century. Channeling Andrade\u2019s own multifaceted approach to art and design, Imagination Is Never Static explores the way that she used drawing as a process of experimentation.",

    "description": "This event does not require registration; see further details below. If you\u2019re in the Calderwood Courtyard, you\u2019ll likely see a newly installed sculpture: a 6th-century terracotta sculpture from Japan\u2019s Kofun period (c. 250\u2013600), called a haniwa. Haniwa were created from coils and slabs of clay, shaped into figures or structures, and then placed around the outside of royal tombs. This figure underwent comprehensive analysis and treatment in preparation for its display. Join objects conservation fellow Kaela Nurmi as she shares how the conservation treatment uncovered original surfaces obscured by layers of restoration, offering insights into how the sculpture was reconstructed in the past. This gallery talk is part of our New on View series, highlighting recent gallery installations and presenting new insights into recent acquisitions or old favorites. Led by: Kaela Nurmi, Objects Conservation Fellow, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies",
