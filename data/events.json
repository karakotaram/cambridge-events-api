    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz.

The Druid Pub in Inman Square, renowned for its authentic Irish atmosphere and live traditional music, is launching a new concert series spotlighting global roots music. The concert series will take place next door at The Lilypad, a cozy venue in Inman Square, offering an intimate setting for this special event. Will Woodson (flute, uilleann pipes) and Caitlin Finley (fiddle) play sparky and driving traditional Irish music that\u2019s grounded in the textures and rhythms of the rich Irish-American soundscape of the 1920s and 30s. With roots in the living Irish musical cultures of Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia, and a tremendous admiration for the first generation of recorded Irish musicians, the duo conjures up the sounds of the dance halls, vaudeville theaters, and house sessions central to Irish-American music from the first half of the twentieth century. In 2019, the two recorded their debut album, \u201cThe Glory Reel\u201d alongside box player and piano accompanist Chris \u201cJunior\u201d Stevens, which Dan Neely of the Irish Echo called \u201ca fabulous album from three of Irish America\u2019s finest.\u201d During the pandemic years, the two made \u201cThe Phonograph Project\u201d, a Patreon-supported series examining 78 recordings of traditional Irish music made in New York City in the 1920s and 30s. More recently, they\u2019ve made musical appearances at the St. Louis Tion\u00f3l, the Patrick J. Touhey Memorial Weekend in Boston and the Ward Archives \u201cArchiving Irish America\u201d conference in Milwaukee. Cait and Will live in Portland, Maine.",

    "description": "Jerry Bergonzi, Tenor Saxophone A fine, high-powered tenor saxophonist with a tone influenced by John Coltrane, a mastery of chord changes, and a strong musical imagination, Jerry Bergonzi has long had an underground following in the Boston area. He started on clarinet when he was eight, switching to alto at 12, and finally to tenor two years later. Bergonzi was inspired early on by Sonny Rollins, Coltrane, and Hank Mobley. He attended Lowell University and then after graduation played electric bass in local bands behind singers and strippers, saving up enough money to move to New York in 1972. After struggling in the Big Apple for seven years and gaining some recognition as a member of Two Generations of Brubeck and of the Dave Brubeck Quartet (with whom he appeared on several Concord albums during 1979-1981), Bergonzi moved back to Boston in 1981, where he developed a strong career both as a tenorman and as an educator. He has since led several groups (including two called Con Brio and Gonz) and recorded for the Plug, Not Fat, Red, and Blue Note labels. \u2014 By Scott Yanow, AllMusic",

Bassist Appleman left the band in 1985 to become Chairman of the Bass Department at Berklee College and was replaced by veteran bassist John Lockwood. Bob Gullotti passed away in 2020 and is remembered as one of the greatest jazz drummers of his generation. Francisco Mela, now on drums, graciously fills the space Bob left behind. Along with their impressive tenure with The Fringe, Garzone, Lockwood, and Mela are in great demand as session players and have played with many of the greats of contemporary jazz. Along with keeping up with a busy performance schedule, each of them are well-respected educators helping to inspire the jazz musicians of tomorrow.

You will then be guided step by step on how to glue the blocks together to make a wooden model of a character from the 8-bit era of gaming. All materials will be provided and no experience is necessary. Final sculptures will vary in size. The tallest is Samus (13 inches) and the shortest are Mario & Link (each 6.7 inches). If you do not finish your sculpture during the event, you are welcome to take everything you need to finish it at home. If you would like to build a character that is not listed in the dropdown menu, feel free to email robertpatricklynch@gmail.com with requests. This is an all ages event. Children under 13 should be signed up at their parent/guardian's discretion. They will need adult supervision and have the ability to sit and do a project for 1-2 hours without being disruptive.",

He turned what he learned inside the media against it, hijacking news cycles with stunts so bold even NYC\u2019s mayor had to weigh in. Deviant Acts mixes stand-up that roasts advertising, media, and pop culture with footage from stunts like The Tourist Lanes (called \u201cbrilliant\u201d by New York Magazine) and the covert installation of The Snowden Statue (featured by Rachel Maddow). Jeff also gets personal, revealing how the media warped his sense of self-worth as a gay man, and how it twists the way we all see ourselves.
